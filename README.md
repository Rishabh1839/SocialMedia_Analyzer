## 🧩 **Overview**

**Social Media Profile Analyzer** is a cybersecurity tool that analyzes mock social-media user profiles and evaluates their **risk level** using automated heuristics such as:

* Suspicious keywords in posts
* Username patterns
* Follower-to-Following ratio
* Email domain credibility
* Bot-like behavior detection
* Posting activity anomalies

This project was created as part of a cybersecurity internship assignment to simulate **OSINT-style profiling** and demonstrate fundamentals of:

✔ Risk scoring
✔ Behavior-based analysis
✔ Data normalization
✔ Keyword intelligence
✔ Python modular design
✔ Clean, testable architecture

## 🏗️ **Project Architecture**

The project is intentionally modular, with each component responsible for a single task:

```
social_media_analyzer/
│── analyzer.py         # Terminal-based profile analyzer
│── mock_data.py        # Contains 50 mock user profiles
│── scoring.py          # Risk scoring logic
│── text_utils.py       # Text cleaning, keyword highlights, normalization
└── README.md           # Documentation
```

Each module plays a critical role:

---

### 🔍 **1. analyzer.py (Main Application Logic)**

Handles:

* User input
* Profile lookup
* Terminal color-coded results
* Integration of scoring + formatting
* Human-readable output

It does NOT calculate risk on its own — instead it delegates this to `scoring.py`.

---

### 📚 **2. mock_data.py (Mock Dataset)**

Provides a structured dictionary of **synthetic user profiles** including:

* Name
* Username
* Email
* Followers / Following
* Profile image URL
* Posts (3–6)
* Flags (summary intel)

Profiles belong to multiple categories:

| Category             | Description                               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Students             | Low-risk patterns, benign posts           |
| Corporate Employees  | Neutral behavior, industry context        |
| Influencers          | High follower ratio, mixed risk           |
| Suspicious Accounts  | Breach/hacking posts, shady email domains |
| Bots / Fake Accounts | Repetitive posts, unrealistic ratios      |

This dataset is deliberately varied to produce **meaningful risk scores**.

---

### 🧠 **3. scoring.py (Risk Engine)**

Performs all cybersecurity intelligence scoring.

The risk evaluation considers:

#### ✔ Keyword intelligence

Suspicious terms add points:

```
"breach", "hack", "dark web", "password", "malware", "exploit"
```

#### ✔ Follower / Following Ratio

Highlights:

* **Very low ratio (bot behavior)**
* **Very high ratio (inflated influence)**
* **Lopsided networking activity**

#### ✔ Username anomalies

Flags:

* Too many digits
* Admin/hacker terms
* Extremely short usernames

#### ✔ Email domain checks

Temporary / anonymous services increase risk:

```
protonmail, tutanota, tempmail, mailinator
```

#### ✔ Posting anomalies

* Zero posts (fake / inactive)
* Very short text (autogenerated)
* Excessively long or spam-like posts

Finally, the score is mapped to:

| Score | Level           |
| ----- | --------------- |
| 60+   | **HIGH Risk**   |
| 35–59 | **MEDIUM Risk** |
| 0–34  | **LOW Risk**    |

---

### ✏️ **4. text_utils.py (Cleaning & Normalization)**

Responsible for:

#### ✔ Name normalization

Makes searches case-insensitive and spacing-safe.

#### ✔ Keyword highlighting

Suspicious keywords are highlighted in output.

#### ✔ Safe field retrieval

Avoids KeyErrors when reading profile attributes.

## 🚀 **How It Works (Flowchart)**

```
           User Input
                ↓
         normalize name
                ↓
        match name/username/email
                ↓
        if not found → error
                ↓
         calculate risk score
                ↓
 highlight suspicious keywords
                ↓
        generate formatted output
                ↓
       display in terminal (color)
```

## 🖥️ **Running the Program**

Make sure Python 3.9+ is installed.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-media-analyzer.git
cd social-media-analyzer
```

```bash
python analyzer.py
```

### 3. Enter a name or username

Examples:

```
John Doe
sarah_smith
john@example.com
```

## 🔐 **Cybersecurity Concepts Demonstrated**

### ✔ OSINT-inspired profiling

Analyzing public-facing metadata to infer security posture.

### ✔ Behavioral risk scoring

Using heuristics to approximate account credibility.

### ✔ Data normalization

Ensuring consistent input handling (case-insensitive, whitespace tolerant).

### ✔ Red flag identification

Detecting patterns tied to:

* Poor cybersecurity hygiene
* Suspicious intent
* Automated behavior
* Anomalous ratios

### ✔ Structured modular development

Clean separation of logic, data, scoring, and utilities.
